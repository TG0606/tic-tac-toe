Added event listeners for every winning combo.

Set up a conditional statement that not allow overwriting in the same boxes and stop writing in any boxes after completing the game.

Started an if statement to check who is the winner.

Made an if statement to check for draw.

Established the draw function.

Created winning message. 

Generated draw message.

Added restart button.

Set up clearboard function to start new game automatically.
