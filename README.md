Review 


This is my first project since I first started learning coding, I very much enjoyed the whole making project process, we got to practise the things we learned at GA in the past two weeks. 

I applied HTML, CSS and Javascript in this project, I was supposed to use Jquery for the project as well, but I really wanted to understand Vanilla Javascript before moving to Jquery. During the project, I absolutely learned a lot things and saw how the code actually working, this definitely helped me to improve my programming skills and have better understanding as a programmer.
