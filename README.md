<h2>GETTING STARTED</h2>

This is my first project. It was hard to begin with since I just started learning how to code two weeks ago. Writing down pseudo code helped me to break the process down into pieces, and allowed me to solve problems logically.  

<h2>STEPS</h2>

<b>1.</b> Created variables for winning combos.

<b>2.</b> Generated a for loop to go through each winning combo.

<b>3.</b> Added event listeners for every winning combo.

<b>4.</b> Set up a conditional statement that not allow overwriting in the same boxes and stop writing in any boxes after completing the game.

<b>5.</b> Started an if statement to check who is the winner.

<b>6.</b> Made an if statement to check for draw.

<b>7.</b> Established the draw function.

<b>8.</b> Created winning message.

<b>9.</b> Generated draw message.

<b>10.</b> Added restart button.

<b>11.</b> Set up clearboard function to start new game automatically.

<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>

<b>1.</b> HTML

<b>2.</b> CSS

<b>3.</b> Javascript

<b>4.</b> jQuery
